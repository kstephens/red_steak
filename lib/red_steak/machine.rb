module RedSteak
  # Machine manages the execution semantics of a StateMachine during the triggering a Transition between
  # the source State and the target State objects of a StateMachine.
  #
  # Features:
  #
  # * It can record Transition history.
  # * Multiple instances can "walk" the same StateMachine.
  # * Instances are easily serialized using Marshal.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   sm = RedSteak::Builder.new.build do
  #     statemachine :my_sm do 
  #       initial :start
  #       final :end
  #
  #       state :start
  #       transition :a #, :name => :'start->a'
  #
  #       state :a
  #       transition :b, :name => :a_b
  #       transition :c # a->c
  #
  #       state :b
  #       transition :c
  #       transition :end
  #
  #       state :c
  #       transition :b
  #       transition :end
  #
  #       state :end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   class MyContext
  #     def guard(m, t) true; end
  #     def effect(m, t) ...; end
  #     def entry(m, s) ...; end
  #     def doActivity(m, s) ...; end
  #     def exit(m, s) ...; end
  #   end
  #
  #   # Synchronous Usage:
  #   m = sm.machine
  #   m.context = MyContext.new(...)
  #   m.start!
  #   m.run!
  #
  #   # Asynchronous Usage:
  #   m = sm.machine
  #   m.context = MyContext.new(...)
  #   m.start!
  #   m.run! do | m |
  #     application.do_something
  #     m.transition_to_next_state!
  #     application.do_something_else
  #   end
  #
  #   # Single-step Usage:
  #   m = sm.machine
  #   m.context = MyContext.new(...)
  #   m.start!
  #   m.transition!(:'start->a')
  #   m.run!(:single)
  #   m.transition!(:ab)
  #   m.run!(:single)
  #   m.transition!(:'b->end')
  #   m.run!(:single)
  #   m.at_end? # => true

    # Run pending transitions.

    # Returns self if #run! is at the top-level, nil if a #run! is already active.
    #
    # If _single_ is true, only one Transition is fired.
    #
    # Behavior:
    #
    # 1. If a Transition is pending,
    # 1.1. Fire the Transition.
    # 1.2. Return immediately, if _single_ is true.
    # 2. While not paused and not at end:
    # 2.1. Yield to block, if given.
    # 2.2. If a Transition is pending,
    # 2.2.1. Fire the Transition.
    # 2.2.2. Return immediately, if _single_ is true.
    # 2.3. Goto 2.
    #
    # Implementation and Semantics:
    #
    # 1. Statemachines cannot be self-recursive, therefore must employ a "transition queue".
    # 2. Statemachines that do not have a queued transition cannot do anything.
    # 3. The queuing of transitions may occur:
    # 3.1. as a side-effect of the entry, doActivity, exit and effect actions (see UML 2 Superstructure for definitions),
    # 3.2. or as stimuli external to the statemachine and it's implied context object.
    #
    # "3.1." describes what might be called a "synchronous" statemachine: 
    # the statemachine was designed such that it should never pause for external stimulus; 
    # there is always a unambiguous transition that is applicable until the end state is reached.  
    # The statemachine assumes control of the application's execution thread.
    #
    # "3.2." describes an "asynchronous" statemachine: the statemachine may pause at a state 
    # if there is no queued transition.  
    # The statemachine must not assume control of the application's execution thread,
    # because the application interacts asynchronously with external stimulus:
    # i.e. a human user behind a web browser.
    #
    # In some cases a statemachine may need to be used synchronously and asynchronously 
    # during a single lifetime. 
    #
    # The UML does not specify that a statemachine should or must *always* fire a transition 
    # if a transition is possible.  The consequences are:
    #
    # 1) Machine#run! may not "do" anything, if no transitions were queued.
    # 2) Machine#run! may return before the statemachine reaches the end date.
    #
    # The application or the statemachines's entry, doAction, exit or effect behaviors
    # must explicitly queue a transition, this object will never automatically
    # queue transitions.
